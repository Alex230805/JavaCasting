# Java RayCasting engine test

#### note: this is a shitty, early developed version of the engine. At the moment it is possible to use 3 differents approach to the 3d render. No texture, no fisheye fixer, nothing but a simple render. It's just an experiment to see what the default graphics library embedded in java is capable of, so it's just me fuck around and test things.
